These are sample configs originally created by the template but not normally included in the git repo.
They are saved here to be used as samples after pulling git to a new machine.

I have yet to make a production config file since that seems so far away, but it would be based off of the
dev config file.

A new download of the software would require copying these files out to the root directory of the project.
